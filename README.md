Baseball win expectancy and expected runs per inning calculators

This is the source for the [win expectancy calculator](https://gregstoll.dyndns.org/~gregstoll/baseball/stats.html) and [expected runs in an inning calculator](https://gregstoll.dyndns.org/~gregstoll/baseball/runsperinning.html).

The main script is `parseretrosheet.py`, which parses play-by-play files in the [Retrosheet](http://www.retrosheet.org/game.htm) format.  To run the script you should download the files from Retrosheet and put them in a `data` directory.

See the `HOWTO` file for how to update everything after adding more data.
