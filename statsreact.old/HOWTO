npm install - install dependencies
npm start - dev server
npm run build - build things into dist/

statsreact.dev is linked to dist
public site is linked to dist.public, so after building and want to publish:
 - copy stuff in dist to dist.public
 - fix up links in /public since app.*.js, etc. will have changed hashes
