processStats stuff for ballsStrikes
 - is this done?
HOWTO is getting long, make it easier to do
This seems wrong:
    # Make sure we don't duplicate keys.
    # Strip off the inning info (for now?) and the curScoreDiff
--

refactoring
 - performance
   - encapsulate creating an re the first time we need it
 - more strongly type things
 - events that start with 'W+' have a bunch of duplication (also 'K+'?)
duplication in processCumulativeStats and processCumulativeBallsStrikesStats
