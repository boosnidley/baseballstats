    <h1>Baseball statistic calculators</h1>
    <ul> 
      <li><a href="stats.php">Win Expectancy Finder</a>, which calculates the
      relative frequency of a team winning given their current situation
      (inning, outs, runners, score difference).  You can also use the
      <a href="graphgame.html">Win Expectancy Grapher</a> to graph the win
      expectancy over an entire game, and visually see the key turning points
      of the game!</li>
      <li><a href="runsperinning.html">Expected Runs in an Inning</a>, which
      calculates the expected number of runs scored in an inning given the
      current situation (outs, runners).  It also shows the historical
      distribution of runs, which is helpful if you only need one run.</li>
