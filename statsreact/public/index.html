<p>This data is from MLB games from 1903-2021, including postseason games. Data are complete back to 1973, mostly complete back to 1950, and somewhat complete back to 1916. It omits games that are less than 9 innings (doubleheaders in 2020) as well as extra inning games where a runner starts on second base (non-playoff games in 2020 and 2021). All data is available at <a href="http://www.retrosheet.org/game.htm">Retrosheet</a>.</p>
